# CODSOFT Internship Tasks - Artificial Intelligence
This respository contains the five levels 3 tasks I completed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at Codsoft. These projects were developed using Python along with powerful libaries 
such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib - Showcasing  my skills in data analysis, model building and visualization. Each tasks reflects my ability to apply AI techniques to solve 
real-world problems through clean, structured, and insightful code. 

# âœ… Task 1 - Chatbot With Rule-Based Responses
 Simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
 predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
 techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
 responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
 language processing and conversation flow.

 # âœ… Task 2 - Tic Tac Toe AI 
  I built a classic Tic-Tac-Toe AI game where a human plays against an unbeatable AI.
  Through this project, I learned key concepts of game theory, and implemented the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to create a smart AI that always plays optimally.

  # âœ… Task 4 - Recommendation System 
  A mini project that builds a simple recommendation engine to suggest movies, books, or products based on user preferences. It uses two key machine learning approaches â€” Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative   Filtering to deliver personalized suggestions.
